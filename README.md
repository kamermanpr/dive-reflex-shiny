## Dive_reflex

A simple app to graph the change in heart rate under three conditions:  
1. Normal breath-hold;    
2. Breath-hold with face submerged in cold water (mammalian dive reflex);    
3. Breath-hold with face submerged in warm water.  

This was my first Shiny app, and was created to help my son with his 6th grade science project.
